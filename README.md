#Unique Value Definition Query Layers
====================================

This is a simple script for ArcMap. It adds a layer to the current map document with a definition query for each unique permutation of a specified attribute value. Rather than having to create a new dataset, or manually create multiple definition queries for multiple variations of an attribute, this script will automatically collect all values and add a layer with a definition query for each.
